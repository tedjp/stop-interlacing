   <h2 id="what">What is interlacing?</h2>
   <p>Interlacing is a way of transmitting video half a frame at a time.
   It's a relic from the days of analog TV and low-compression codecs,
   where a reasonably good picture could be transmitted using about half
   the bandwidth by transmitting alternating lines of each frame.</p>

   <h2 id="problem">The problem with interlacing</h2>
   <p>Modern displays refresh the entire picture in one go. When the source
   video is interlaced it only contains half a new picture. The display
   either retains the existing half of the picture, resulting in a
   "comb" effect on the edges of objects, or it employs
   imperfect deinterlacing algorithms to try to reconstruct a full frame.
   Having only half the picture each frame means the deinterlacer is always
   trying to reconstruct detail for which it has no information, and therefore
   the picture looks worse than a full-frame (progressive) picture.</p>

   <p>The effect is especially egregious for sports content where the object
   of focus tends to be a small, fast-moving object. As it moves across the
   screen, a ball is only half-displayed at a time. Moving fast enough, the
   deinterlacer won't identify the two half-balls as the same moving object
   (because it travels so far between frames) and the ball will be
   half-invisible.</p>

   <h2 id="solution">The solution: progressive video</h2>
   <p>Progressive, full-frame video doesn't have the problem of trying to
   reconstruct missing information. Video providers should commit
   to an end-to-end progressive video pipeline.
   For example 2160p, 1080p or even 720p. 1080i is insufficient, and especially
   poor for sports content.</p>
