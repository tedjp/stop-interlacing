  <h2 id="what">What is interlacing?</h2>
  <p>Interlacing is a way of transmitting video half a frame at a time.
  It's a relic from the days of analog TV and low-compression codecs,
  where a reasonably good picture could be transmitted using about half
  the bandwidth by transmitting alternating lines of each frame.</p>

  <h2 id="problem">The problem with interlacing</h2>
  <p>Modern displays refresh the entire picture in one go. When the source
  video is interlaced it only contains half a new picture. The display
  either retains the existing half of the picture, resulting in a
  "comb" effect on the edges of objects, or it employs
  imperfect deinterlacing algorithms to try to reconstruct a full frame.
  Having only half the picture each frame means the deinterlacer is always
  trying to reconstruct detail for which it has no information, and therefore
  the picture looks worse than a full-frame (progressive) picture.</p>

  <p>The effect is especially egregious for sports content where the object
  of focus tends to be a small, fast-moving object. As it moves across the
  screen, a ball is only half-displayed at a time. Moving fast enough, the
  deinterlacer won't identify the two half-balls as the same moving object
  (because it travels so far between frames) and the ball will be
  half-invisible.</p>

  <h2 id="solution">The solution: progressive video</h2>
  <p>Progressive, full-frame video doesn't have the problem of trying to
  reconstruct missing information. Video providers should commit
  to an end-to-end progressive video pipeline.
  For example 2160p, 1080p or even 720p. 1080i is insufficient, and especially
  poor for sports content.</p>
